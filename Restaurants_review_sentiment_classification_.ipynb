However, there is room for improvement as we cannot say for sure that this particular model is best for the problem at hand. Hence, our aim is to improve the model in any way possible. One important factor in the performances of these models are their hyperparameters, once we set appropriate values for these hyperparameters, the performance of a model can improve significantly. In this article, we will find out how we can find optimal values for the hyperparameters of a model by using GridSearchCV."

As mentioned above, the performance of a model significantly depends on the value of hyperparameters. Note that there is no way to know in advance the best values for hyperparameters so ideally, we need to try all possible values to know the optimal values.

        "\n",
        "**1: Bernoulli:** (All features are binary.) (Two class output) [Purchase / No].This type of algorithm is useful in data having binary features. The features can be of value yes or not, granted or not granted, useful or useless, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2: Multinomial:** (Features are discrete. Multi class classifier, generally) Rating of 1 to 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used for discrete counts. For example, let’s say,  we have a text classification problem. Here one step further than  Bernoulli trials and instead of “word occurring in the document”, we have “count how often word occurs in the document”, you can think of it as “number of times outcome number x_i is observed over the n trials”.  or\n",
        "\n",
        "This is used when the features represent the frequency.Suppose you have a text document and you extract all the unique words and create multiple features where each feature represents the count of the word in the document. In such a case, we have a frequency as a feature. In such a scenario, we use multinomial Naive Bayes.It is known to work well with text classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, because the probability estimate is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of a feature's value. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, **called pseudocount**, in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is c**alled Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one**, and **Lidstone smoothing in the general case**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3 Gaussian:** (Features are: Continuous data) [Height: 1.63,1.64,1.65...]\n",
        "\n",
        "This type of Naive Bayes is used when variables are continuous in nature. It assumes that all the variables have a normal distribution. So if you have some variables which do not have this property, you might want to transform them to the features having distribution normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution.and uses property of normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4: Categorical:** The categorical distribution is the generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for a categorical random variable, i.e. for a discrete variable with more than two possible outcomes, such as the roll of a die. On the other hand, the categorical distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution, in that it gives the probabilities of potential outcomes of a single drawing rather than multiple drawings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5: Complement:** Complement Naive Bayes is somewhat an adaptation of the standard Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Multinomial Naive Bayes does not perform very well on imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced datasets are datasets where the number of examples of some class is higher than the number of examples belonging to other classes. This means that the distribution of examples is not uniform. This type of dataset can be difficult to work with as a model may easily overfit this data in favor of the class with more number of examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**working:** Complement Naive Bayes is particularly suited to work with imbalanced datasets. In complement Naive Bayes, instead of calculating the probability of an item belonging to a certain class, we calculate the probability of the item belonging to all the classes. This is the literal meaning of the word, complement and hence is called Complement Naive Bayes.\n",
